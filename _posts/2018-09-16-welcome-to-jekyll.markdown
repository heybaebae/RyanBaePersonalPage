Hello everyone! My name is Ryan Bae, and I am a data scientist who is currently a MS student at University of Washington. Originally coming from aerospace engineering background, I decided to switch my career to data science in 2017, and it's been a crazy journey the past 1.5 years!

I made this page to organize my project portfolio, learn about Github Pages, and have my own website I can link people to when networking. It contains information about me, my education and professional background, hobbies, and last but not least, this blog. :)

I will make periodic updates to this blog as my career in data science and machine learning progresses. Thanks for reading!

Ryan
