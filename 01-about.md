My name is Ryan Bae, and I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer currently based in Seattle, WA. My primary interest is in applied machine learning, building backend infrastructure, and optimizing business operations and products.

I am currently a [Masters in Data Science](https://www.datasciencemasters.uw.edu/) candidate at University of Washington. I worked as a data scientist intern at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/)'s Core Data Science team in summer of 2018. During the 2017-2018 academic year I was a machine learning engineer intern at AI startup called [Clobotics](https://www.clobotics.com/).

Prior to becoming a data scientist I worked as a spacecraft propulsion engineer at [SSL](http://sslmda.com/). I got my Bachelor's and Master's in aerospace engineering from [UCLA](https://www.mae.ucla.edu/) and [Michigan](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/mse/), specializing in rocket propulsion and computational fluid dynamics. During my graduate studies, I worked in the [Plasma Sciences and Technology Lab](https://pstlab.engin.umich.edu/) under Prof. John Foster.

Please take a look at the resume page for my complete professional and academic history.

In my spare time I enjoy hiking and exploring the great outdoors that the Pacific Northwest has to offer. I am also an amateur guitar player, and have played in various groups ranging from acoustic/country to student jazz bands/combos at University of Michigan.
