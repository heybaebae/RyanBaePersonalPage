My name is Ryan Bae, and I am a senior data & applied scientist currently based in Seattle, WA. My primary interest is in applied machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning. 

I have been working as a data scientist at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/)'s Windows + Devices Data team since 2019, working to improve Windows 10 and 11 operating system using data science and machine learning. More specifically, areas of my work include the following:

* Deriving business insights from customer feedback for Windows OS by correlating with diagnostic telemetry (patent pending)
* Advancing in-house NLP knowledge by applying latest research techniques to customer feedback 
* Evaluating reliabilty and fairness of on-client ML models 
* Developing novel statistical methods for pattern-less personal data detection
* Mentoring other early-in-career data scientists and interns

I graduated from [Masters in Data Science](https://www.datasciencemasters.uw.edu/) program at University of Washington in 2019, during which I interned at the same team at Microsoft in summer of 2018. Earlier during my studies I also worked as a machine learning engineer intern at an AI startup called [Clobotics](https://www.clobotics.com/).

Prior to becoming a data scientist I worked as a spacecraft propulsion engineer at [Maxar (formerly SSL)](http://sslmda.com/). I got my Bachelor's and Master's in aerospace engineering from [UCLA](https://www.mae.ucla.edu/) and [Michigan](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/mse/), specializing in rocket propulsion and computational fluid dynamics. During my graduate studies, I worked in the [Plasma Sciences and Technology Lab](https://pstlab.engin.umich.edu/) under Prof. John Foster.

Please take a look at the [resume page](https://ryanbae89.github.io/resume/) for my complete professional and academic history.

And Please take a look at the [projects page](https://ryanbae89.github.io/projects/) for a portfolio of some the data science/machine learning projects I've completed in the past outside of work.

In my spare time I enjoy hiking and exploring the great outdoors that the Pacific Northwest has to offer. I am also an amateur guitar player, and have played in various groups ranging from acoustic/country to student jazz bands/combos at University of Michigan. Take a look at my [recreation page](https://ryanbae89.github.io/recreation/) for more information.
