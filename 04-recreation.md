This page has some of my hobbies and things I like to do outside of work and school.

In my spare time I enjoy hiking in the Cascades.

My current list of completed hikes in the Pacific Northwest area:

* Mount Si
* Wallace Falls
* Poo Poo Point

Hikes in other places:

* Yosemite Falls Hike

I also played golf in high school, and occasionally hit the links every now and then.

I've also been playing guitar since high school in various groups and ensembles, including jazz bands/combos. My genre of interest are jazz, blues, acoustic, and classic rock.
