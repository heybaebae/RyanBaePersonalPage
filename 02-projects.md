Below are some data science and machine learning projects from academia and personal studies. Also feel free to visit my [Github page](https://github.com/heybaebae).

# Gun Violence in the United States

Self project in the works, more info coming soon...

# Video Similarity Search Engine

This is the capstone project for the MS Data Science program I am finishing up at University of Washington. Using various featurization methods, we convert videos into feature vectors which are queried using k-nearest neighbor search.

Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

# News Articles Recommender and Analyzer

News articles recommender and analyzer performs topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to recommend to the user the best matching national news articles.

It also tags topics to each article and outputs word cloud visualization in addition to the recommendation system.
